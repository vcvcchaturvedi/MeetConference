# MeetConference
This code is in development stage and has been forked and worked upon from the repository by http://webrtc-experiment.com/

The project aims to solve WebRTC based Conferencing and provides a one stop solution to same with all the features.

Currently, file sending in chat window is under development stages and when users join in during a live conference, a new video file is created for the recording and simultaneous video recordings are not merged in single output recoding file, thus, creating multiple recordings files at download time, one each for the session since every user joined in since recording.
